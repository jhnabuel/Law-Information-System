# Law Information System
This is our final project for CCC151 Information Management. It is an information management system that keep tracks the data of a small law firm. It keeps records about the lawyers that work there, their name, specialization, etc. This application also keeps track of the firm's cases and its clients. Moreover, it also keeps tracks of which client has a case and which cases are clients and their respective lawyers involved.

# How It's Made
Tech used: Python and MySQL 
We designed a relational database that keeps track of three entities namely: Lawyer, Client, and Case. We also used PyQt5, a library that lets you use the Qt GUI framework from Python. Python is used for the backend for easy connection between front and backend. Lastly, we used HeidiSQL for the database through Laragon.
